                    <p>To book our services, you must submit a request through our website, providing accurate information about the item(s) to be delivered, pickup location, delivery location, and any special handling instructions. We will provide a quote based on this information.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4.2 Payment</h3>
                    <p>Payment must be made in advance of service through our approved payment methods. All fees are non-refundable except as expressly provided in these Terms.

                    <p>We will provide an estimated delivery window based on availability. While we strive to meet all scheduled times, we cannot guarantee exact pickup or delivery times due to factors beyond our control such as traffic, weather, or seller delays.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5.2 Item Inspection</h3>
                    <p>Our drivers will conduct a basic visual inspection of items at pickup. However, we are not responsible for verifying the condition, functionality, or completeness of items beyond obvious external damage.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5.3 Delivery Confirmation</h3>

                    <h3>5.4 Failed Delivery Attempts</h3>

Claims for damage must be reported within 24 hours of delivery with photographic evidence.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.2 Limitation of Liability</h3>

                    <p>You may cancel a scheduled delivery at least 24 hours before the scheduled pickup time for a full refund. Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the scheduled pickup time will be subject to a 50% cancellation fee.</p>
